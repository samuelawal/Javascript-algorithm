### 1. Body Mass Index Calculator

The formulas for calculating BMI are

$$
BMI = \frac{weightInPounds * 703} {heightInInches * heightInInches}
$$

$$
BMI = \frac{weightInKilograms} {heightInMeters * heightInMeters}
$$

Create a BMI calculator that reads the userâ€™s weight in pounds and height in inches (or, if you prefer, the userâ€™s weight in kilograms and height in meters), then calculates and displays the userâ€™s body mass index. Also, display the following information from the Department of Health and Human Services/National Institutes of Health so the user can evaluate his/her BMI:

### 2. World Population Growth Calculator

Use the web to determine the current world population and the annual world population growth rate. Write an application that inputs these values, then displays the estimated world population after one, two, three, four and five years.

### 3. Car-Pool Savings Calculator

Research several car-pooling websites. Create an application that calculates your daily driving cost, so that you can estimate how much money could be saved by car pooling, which also has other advantages such as reducing carbon emissions and reducing traffic congestion. The application should input the following information and display the userâ€™s cost per day of driving to work:
a) Total miles driven per day.
b) Cost per gallon of gasoline.
c) Average miles per gallon.
d) Parking fees per day.
e) Tolls per day.
